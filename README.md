Thank you Tiqets.com team, for the opportunity to show my skills through your assignment.

## Tech used

- React (Hooks)
- Typescript
- Plain CSS with CSS4 variables

## The development environment

You can fork or clone this repository to start working and use `yarn` to install the JS dependencies.

    $ git clone https://github.com/tiqets/tq-assignment-js.git
    $ cd tq-assignment-js
    $ yarn

To start the development server, open a terminal and run:

    $ yarn start

A browser window should open with the development environment. Otherwise go to http://localhost:3000. You need to keep this terminal window running for the development server to work.

To run the tests, run:

    $ yarn test
